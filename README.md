### 🔬 Current Research
**Machine Learning + Molecular Dynamics (Chemistry Research Project)**  
I’m exploring how neural networks can approximate potential energy surfaces with physics-level accuracy.  
This includes:
- Running molecular dynamics simulations to generate position-energy datasets
- Implementing radial and angular symmetry functions
- Training Behler–Parrinello style neural networks in PyTorch

This project has helped me combine my interests in computing, physics, and chemistry while learning how AI can accelerate scientific discovery.
